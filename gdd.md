Each room is a unique card
Some rooms have unique features that effect other rooms for instance:

I should probably play blue prince

2D would be simpler
3D would be cooler and allow full SM64 movement

[-p->[ = water pipe

This is a room with a water pipe
________
[      ]
[      ]
[-p->  ]
[__[ ]_]

The water from the room flows downward, untill it hits a room where the water can't escape
which raises the water level of the room, making it swimable and lifitng boxes in the room up

[^] = a big fan

__[ ]__
[     ]
[ [^] ]
[ [ ] ]
[_[_]_]

The wind from the fan will blow upwards until there is no opening above it, lifting the player up and turning turbines

The player is able to return to the lobby and re-arrange the map, opening up new areas based on how rooms interact

Each room is uniquely designed, and can also have item unlocks in them that need to be activated by other rooms (Electric current unlocks a gate or something like that)

Traditional items:
- Something that lets you swim
- The ability to rotate rooms [! high complexity]
- An umbrella to ride air currents

movement HAS to be fun, you're asking the player to traverse the same rooms over and over, this needs to be optimized to feel fun and like there are secrets to discover

Should rooms be square?:
- Rooms being arbitrary shapes gives some additional design space, simple intuitive way to make certain rooms unable to line up in specific ways

Imagine-view:
- At any point the player can platform around any room they've discovered
- use a stripped down art style with the same physics while imagining a room
- maybe the player can upgrade how many rooms they can imagine at once
- possibly the "chests" have different contents if they are reached in their imaginary version, that always relate to the players mental abilities (rotating rooms, imagine more rooms at once)

Stuff to consider:
- Designing the game to support a randomizer has some benefits
-		replayability
-		The way room data will work naturally supports it
